The scoring system evaluates leads based on:
- **Completeness (25%):** Data completeness and quality
- **Verification (20%):** Verified status and AI scores
- **Business Value (25%):** Industry type and revenue potential
- **Location (10%):** Geographic premium locations
- **Source (10%):** Data source quality and reliability
- **Freshness (10%):** How recent the lead data is
